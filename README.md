# Horizon Atlas

> **Unofficial.** Horizon Atlas is a fork made by a player. It is not affiliated with, endorsed by or supported by
> Horizon's authors, Mojang or Microsoft. Do not ask them for help with it; open an issue here.

Horizon Atlas is a fork of the [Horizon](https://github.com/horizon-rust/horizon) **launcher**. The game is Horizon's, unmodified;
Atlas changes the launcher only. Minecraft: Java Edition is a product of Mojang and Microsoft, and you need your own copy of it.

## What it is for

- **Offline play without a Microsoft account.** Play starts the game under an offline name of your choice. There is no Microsoft sign-in in Atlas.
- **Choose your own `26.3.jar`.** Point the launcher at the client jar from your own copy of Minecraft: Java Edition, wherever it is on disk.
- **Releases that follow Horizon's launcher releases.** A daily check turns each new Horizon launcher release into an Atlas release, with Atlas's changes replayed on top.
- **Signed with Atlas's own key.** The launcher updates itself from this repository and checks the signature before it installs anything. Game builds are still Horizon's, signed by Horizon's key.

## Install

Download from the [releases page](https://github.com/nezbut/horizon-atlas/releases/latest).

- **Windows:** run `horizon-launcher-setup.exe` (`horizon-launcher-setup-arm64.exe` on ARM). It is not code-signed, so SmartScreen may say "Windows protected your PC": choose **More info**, then **Run anyway**.
- **Linux (x86-64) and macOS (Apple Silicon):**

  ```sh
  curl -fsSL https://raw.githubusercontent.com/nezbut/horizon-atlas/main/install.sh | sh
  ```

  It installs for your user only and puts `horizon-atlas` in `~/.local/bin`. Linux also has an AppImage on the releases page, and Intel Macs have `horizon-launcher-macos-x64.zip`.
- **macOS:** the app is not notarized, so macOS may refuse to open it the first time. Right-click it and choose **Open**, or run `xattr -dr com.apple.quarantine "<path to the app>"` (`install.sh` already does this).

## First run

1. Have Minecraft: Java Edition 26.3 installed once, in any launcher (the official one, Prism, Modrinth App and others work).
2. Open Atlas and press **Prepare**. It finds your copy of 26.3 and prepares the game from it. If it cannot find it, press **Choose jar…** and pick the jar yourself.
3. Press **Play**.

The jar must be the **26.3 release** jar: Horizon reproduces 26.3 only, and the launcher refuses any other jar. The only way Atlas gets Minecraft is from your own copy of Minecraft: Java Edition.

## Limits

- **Online-mode servers are not supported.** They need a Microsoft sign-in, and Atlas has none. Atlas is for offline play.
- The game itself is Horizon's, unmodified. Atlas changes the launcher only.
- Atlas builds the launcher for Windows (x64, ARM64), Linux (x86-64) and macOS (Apple Silicon and Intel).

## How it stays in sync

Atlas is a short list of small commits (patches: `offline-play`, `choose-jar`, `own-releases`, `own-keys`, `branding`) on top of one of Horizon's `launcher@X.Y.Z` tags.
Every day a workflow checks for a newer Horizon launcher tag, replays the patches onto it, tests, and publishes a release. If a patch no longer applies, nothing is published and an issue names the patch.
Atlas's versions are its own (`0.x`); each release title says which Horizon launcher it is based on.

## License

MIT, like Horizon (see [LICENSE](LICENSE)). Horizon is by Ludovic Marie and the Horizon contributors; Atlas is built on their work. See [THIRD_PARTY_NOTICES.md](THIRD_PARTY_NOTICES.md) for other credits.

# Horizon

**Minecraft: Java Edition 26.3, rewritten in Rust.** Your worlds, the same rules and the same terrain as the Java game, checked against it by hundreds of differential tests, in one native program with no Java. Free, open source (MIT) and unofficial: you play it with your own copy of Java Edition.

## What works today

Everything below is in the current release.

- **The game.** Survival, creative, hardcore and spectator; vanilla world generation in all three dimensions, mobs, villagers, raids, redstone, every command, the HUD and the recipe book. Vanilla saves open as they are, and worlds from 1.8 to 26.2 are upgraded.
- **Multiplayer.** Join vanilla and Horizon servers (online mode included), open a world to LAN, or invite friends with a code from the launcher's Home page.
- **Graphics.** Distant terrain up to 1,024 chunks, graphics presets, HDR and controllers, all off by default where they would change the vanilla look ([settings](https://playhorizon.dev/docs/settings)).
- **Packs.** Resource packs, data packs and shader packs ([below](#mods-and-shader-packs)).
- **Mods.** Content mods and native Rust mods, installed from the launcher ([below](#mods-and-shader-packs)).
- **Servers.** Host one from the launcher, or run `horizon-server` on a VPS ([below](#host-a-server)).
- **The launcher.** It installs and updates the game, prepares its files from your copy of Minecraft, and updates itself.

<sub>Nightly 2026-11-05 on a Mac mini (Apple M4 Pro, Metal): vanilla's textures, no mods or shader packs, render distance 32 with distant terrain on.</sub>

## Performance

**Horizon draws more frames per second than Java Edition, and loads faster, on the same machine, world and path.** `tools/perf_bench.py` runs each game in turn, from a fresh world (seed 1234), waiting for the terrain and then flying it over a village, a forest, an ocean and a mountain. Measured on 2026-10-29/30 on an idle Windows 11 machine (Ryzen 7 9800X3D, RTX 5080), Horizon v0.2.97 as the launcher installs it, 1280x720 in a window, VSync off, three games per figure. Frames per second, mean of the four scenes, with the slowest 1% of frames in brackets:

| Render distance | Horizon v0.2.97 | Vanilla 26.3 | Vanilla + mods |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| 8 chunks | 3,289 (1,327) | 2,437 (640) | 2,375 (709) |
| 16 chunks | 2,074 (598) | 1,661 (375) | 1,586 (432) |
| 32 chunks | 1,207 (333) | 1,031 (176) | 879 (264) |

"Vanilla + mods" is Sodium, Lithium, FerriteCore and ImmediatelyFast. Horizon reaches the title screen in 2.9–3.2 s against vanilla's 7.5–7.7 s (the modded client's 10.8–11.1 s), loads a scene's chunks 2.9–3.8 times faster, and playing holds a steady working set of 1.1–1.7 GB against 1.9–2.9 GB. Every scene with its confidence interval and the run's load log: [the 2026-10-29 reports](benchmarks/perf/windows-9800x3d-5080-2026-10-29.md). Method, and how to measure your own machine: [docs/benchmark.md](docs/benchmark.md). [playhorizon.dev/benchmarks](https://playhorizon.dev/benchmarks) puts these runs beside a 2016 laptop, a Mac mini and a gaming desktop.

## Download

Get **the Horizon launcher** from [playhorizon.dev](https://playhorizon.dev), or from [the launcher releases](https://github.com/horizon-rust/horizon/releases?q=launcher&expanded=true):

| Platform | File | Needs |
| --- | --- | --- |
| Windows x64 | `horizon-launcher-setup.exe` | Windows 10 or 11, a GPU with Vulkan or DirectX 12 |
| Windows on Arm | `horizon-launcher-setup-arm64.exe` | Windows 11 on Arm |
| macOS, Apple Silicon | `horizon-launcher-macos-arm64.dmg` | macOS 12 or later |
| macOS, Intel | `horizon-launcher-macos-x64.dmg` | macOS 12 or later |
| Linux x86-64 | `horizon-launcher-linux-x86_64.AppImage` or `.tar.gz` | a glibc distribution, X11 or Wayland, a GPU with Vulkan or OpenGL 3.3 |

**You also need a Microsoft account that owns Minecraft: Java Edition.** You sign in with it in the launcher, which plays only with an account that owns the game ([why](docs/microsoft-account.md)). Horizon contains no Minecraft code or assets: an existing install (official launcher, Prism, MultiMC...) is reused, and without one the launcher downloads 26.3 from Mojang for your account. Step by step: [Install and first launch](https://playhorizon.dev/docs/install).

## Mods and shader packs

- **Content mods** (`.hmod`): blocks, items, recipes, loot, models and textures, with no code.
- **Native mods** (`.hnmod`): Rust that the launcher compiles into the game for you, with nothing to install.
- **Java mods** (Fabric, NeoForge, Forge) don't run: Horizon has no Java. The launcher carries over the data and assets inside their jars, and imports modpacks (`.mrpack`, CurseForge zips, Prism instances) the same way ([modpacks](https://playhorizon.dev/docs/modpacks)).
- **Shader packs**: Iris/OptiFine-format packs (`shaders/` folders) and Horizon's own WGSL packs, under Video Settings → Shader Packs ([pack format](docs/shaders.md)).

Mods are off by default: a fresh install plays exactly like vanilla 26.3. The launcher's Mods page browses Horizon's registry and Modrinth. [Mods](https://playhorizon.dev/docs/mods) · [make a mod](docs/mods.md).

## Host a server

The launcher's **Servers** page creates, starts, backs up and updates a server, and invites friends. On a VPS, `horizon-server` installs with one command, needs no Java, and takes vanilla 26.3 and Horizon players alike. [Host a server](https://playhorizon.dev/docs/hosting) ([reference](docs/hosting.md)).

## Agent control

AI agents and scripts can play Horizon. `horizon-ctl`, shipped with the game, reads its state as JSON and acts like a player; `horizon-ctl mcp` serves the same commands over MCP.

```sh
horizon-ctl launch --world Survival --seed 5 --wait   # finds the version the launcher installed
horizon-ctl state                                       # position, health, food, target, screen...
horizon-ctl goto -0.5 65 -2.5 --near 2.5                # walks there along a path
horizon-ctl break -1 65 -3                              # mines it; replies with the drops
```

`horizon-ctl help` lists every command. [Agent control](docs/native-client.md#agent-control-horizon-ctl-and-mcp).

## Build from source

Needs Rust 1.90+, Python 3.10+, JDK 25, and on Linux `libasound2-dev libudev-dev`. `horizon-prepare` builds the game's resources from **your own copy** of Java Edition 26.3 (checked against `research-lock.json`) and never downloads it:

1. **Client:** play 26.3 once in the official launcher. Horizon reads `~/.minecraft` (or `--minecraft-dir` / `HORIZON_MINECRAFT_DIR`).
2. **Server jar:** the 26.3 server jar (`downloads.server.url` in `versions/26.3/26.3.json`), passed once with `--server-jar` or `HORIZON_SERVER_JAR`.

```sh
git clone https://github.com/horizon-rust/horizon.git
cd horizon
cargo run --release -p horizon-prepare -- --prepare --server-jar ~/Downloads/server.jar   # needs JDK 25
cargo run --release -p horizon-prepare -- sounds   # optional: sounds from your launcher install
cargo run --release -p horizon-client
```

Prepared files land in the gitignored `.local/`: never commit or share them. Options, controls and architecture: [the native client guide](docs/native-client.md); all developer docs: [docs/README.md](docs/README.md).

## Contributing

Issues and pull requests are welcome: read [CONTRIBUTING.md](CONTRIBUTING.md) (vanilla first, small pull requests), and see [ROADMAP.md](ROADMAP.md) or [playhorizon.dev/hub](https://playhorizon.dev/hub) for what's next. Questions: [Discord](https://discord.gg/playhorizon). Before a pull request, run the self-check and paste its output:

```sh
git config core.hooksPath .githooks
python3 tools/pr_ready.py
```

It runs rustfmt, clippy, the touched crates' tests, the Python tests, the public-tree check and the vanilla harnesses your change affects. Never commit game files, decompiled source or prepared resources.

## Project status

**Player-visible gaps: 0 open** of the 833 the [port ledger](tools/port_ledger.py) found, reading every vanilla 26.3 method against Horizon's code: vanilla behaviour a player would notice that Horizon doesn't have yet. By area: Animals [0](https://github.com/horizon-rust/horizon/issues/3512); Monsters and bosses [0](https://github.com/horizon-rust/horizon/issues/3513); Entities, projectiles, vehicles and decorations [0](https://github.com/horizon-rust/horizon/issues/3514); Items, enchantments and inventories [0](https://github.com/horizon-rust/horizon/issues/3515); Blocks, redstone and fluids [0](https://github.com/horizon-rust/horizon/issues/3516); World, world generation and saves [0](https://github.com/horizon-rust/horizon/issues/3517); Screens, HUD and client packets [0](https://github.com/horizon-rust/horizon/issues/3518); Entity and block rendering, models [0](https://github.com/horizon-rust/horizon/issues/3519); Server and players on the server [0](https://github.com/horizon-rust/horizon/issues/3520); Mob AI, villagers and raids [0](https://github.com/horizon-rust/horizon/issues/3521). This number goes down as gaps close (`tools/parity_gaps.py`); the table below says what the harnesses compare.

The table is the project's own audit of what the harnesses compare, subsystem by subsystem: a score says how much of that subsystem the harnesses cover and pass, not that nothing else differs from vanilla. What players still run into: [known issues](docs/known-issues.md).

### What the harnesses compare

Scores: 0 (absent), 0.25 (started), 0.5 (playable, major features missing), 0.75 (mostly complete) or 1 (its harnesses cover the subsystem and pass). Last audited 2026-10-13: the harnesses pass on Linux and macOS. The [port ledger](tools/port_ledger.py) adds a method-by-method view of what is ported.

| Subsystem | Score | Main gaps |
| --- | ---: | --- |
| Window, input and game loop | 1 | None: game loop, options, camera, auto-jump, toggle sprint/sneak and frame limiter match |
| Assets and resources | 1 | None: item models match over 196,290 stacks; the resource pack screen over 3,000 sessions |
| Network protocol and multiplayer | 1 | None: joins vanilla servers; the dedicated server matches vanilla's files, login, configuration, play and command tree; LAN discovery over 462 cases (offline mode only) |
| Chunk storage and palettes | 1 | None: client and saves share paletted containers, identical to vanilla over 266 scenarios |
| Section meshing | 1 | None: 112 scenes and over a million quads identical to vanilla |
| Rendering | 1 | None: entity models, block entity renderers (407 cases) and animations (296), HUD overlays (2,200 states), the recipe book (600), player list, subtitles and world border match |
| Lighting | 1 | None: saved and relit light matches vanilla, slabs and stairs included |
| World generation | 1 | None: 2,352 whole chunks over 225 structure sites, in all three dimensions, identical to vanilla |
| Region files and saves | 1 | None: saves round-trip with vanilla; worlds from 1.8 to 26.2 upgrade as vanilla's DataFixers do |
| Entities and physics | 1 | None: attributes, spawn rules, natural spawning (15,500 cases), raids and patrols (1,900), `finalizeSpawn` (24,000) and mob AI (92 scenarios) match |
| Interaction and inventory | 1 | None: menu clicks over 8,000 sequences; recipe book placement (6,000), buttons (1,200), saved book (1,500), loom and crafter screens (1,600) |
| Menus, HUD and chat | 1 | None: every command (758 over 39,685 inputs), scoreboards (81,000 operations), the player list (872,000 draw calls), chat and its suggestions (3,000 sessions) match |
| Audio | 1 | None: the sound engine, sound events, music, situational music, ambience and subtitles match vanilla |
| Block behaviours and ticking | 1 | None: block updates, random ticks, redstone, dispensers (6,000 cases), crafters (4,000), container spills (4,000), copper golems and the sculk family (435 scenarios) match |
